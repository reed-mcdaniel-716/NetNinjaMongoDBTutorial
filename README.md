## 1. Introduction to MongoDB
- **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database, meaning that rather then storing tabular data like in a relational database, you store data in other formats like documents ([fuller comparison here](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/nosql-vs-relational-databases))
- "**MongoDB** stores data in ***flexible, JSON-like documents***, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time"([docs](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb))
- `Mongoose`, a Node.js package, is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment ([docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose))
